# pd-location-audio-app
Interactive audio project built in Pure Data (Pd), exploring GPS- and sensor-driven sound playback and generative layers. The project focuses on deploying Pd patches via libpd into mobile (iOS/Android) and web-based applications.
# Call for Pd / libpd Developer (Paid Collaboration)
I am a sound artist developing an interactive audio project using **Pure Data (Pd)** as the core sound engine. I am seeking an experienced **Pd / libpd developer** to support the technical development and help translate existing Pd patches into a **mobile (iOS / Android) and/or web-based application**.

The project focuses on **location-aware and sensor-driven audio interaction**, where GPS data and environmental input (e.g. microphone/noise levels) trigger playback and generative sound layers. Pd patches are already under active development; the collaboration is focused on **integration, architecture, and deployment**, not sound design.

## Scope
- Review and advise on existing Pd patches  
- Integrate Pd using **libpd**  
- Support mobile and/or web application development  
- Advise on performance and real-time audio considerations  

## Requirements
- Strong Pure Data experience  
- Proven libpd integration work  
- Experience with mobile and/or web audio applications  
- Familiarity with GPS or sensor-driven systems is a plus  

This is a **paid**, research-driven artistic project with potential for extended collaboration.

**Contact:**  
Please open an issue in this repository or reach out with relevant Pd/libpd work or repositories.
